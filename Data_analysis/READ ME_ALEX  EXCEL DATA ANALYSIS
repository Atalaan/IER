2. Installing the Data Analysis Toolpak

In this study we want to know the difference between 2019 and 2020. 
To investigate this, we perform a t-test and ANOVA tests. 
In this study we will use Excel, because it's a fast and reliable option for simple statistical problems. 
To make use of Excel's standard included statistical calculation software, you need to enable the Data Analysis Toolpak add-in in the options menu.
Go to the add-in tab and enable the Data Analysis Toolpak. 
Excel should install this automatically now. With help of this feature all tests were done in this study.

3. How to use the Data Analysis Toolpak

To perform any of the tests with the help of the Analysis Toolpak:
Go to the data tab in Excel and click on the button Data Analysis 
A window should pop-up and now you have to select the desired statistical calculation you would like to use 
Depending on which statistical calculation you choose, you will need to fill in necessary information such as which cells contain the data that needs to be processed. 
The Analysis Toolpak then creates an output table with the results of the calculation. 
These can be used to create graphs and make grounded conclusions.
